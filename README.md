# ICEMAN-CustomerOrderManagement-Database
The ICEMAN-IceCreamOrderManagement project on GitHub aims to develop an efficient application for ICE MAN, a renowned ice cream seller company, to streamline and manage their main processes. This application allows customers to place customized ice cream orders while ensuring accurate recording, seamless order tracking, and convenient billing.

## Key Features:

1. Customer Management: The application records customer details, including Customer Number, Name, Contact Details (Home, Mobile, Email), Address, and NIC (National Identity Card). This information helps ensure personalized service and a better customer experience.

2. Order Management: Orders are identified by a unique Order Number and linked to specific customers. The application records Order Details, such as flavor, additions, and quantity, allowing customers to customize their ice cream orders to their preferences.

3. Order Status Tracking: Each order is assigned a status (prepared, cancelled, pending), providing real-time updates to customers about the progress of their orders. This feature enhances transparency and improves customer satisfaction.

4. Billing: Once an order is completed, the application automatically calculates the bill. The bill includes relevant information such as Bill Number, Order Number, Customer Number, Cashier Number, and other pertinent details. Accurate billing ensures efficient payment processing.

5. Multiple Orders and Order Items: Customers can place multiple orders simultaneously, and each order can include different types of ice cream items. This flexibility allows for a diverse selection and accommodates varying customer preferences.

6. Cashier Authentication: Cashiers log in to the system using their unique username and password. The application records cashier details in the employee table, ensuring secure access and maintaining individual accountability.

The GitHub repository will contain the source code, documentation, and resources required for the ICEMAN-IceCreamOrderManagement project. The documentation will provide detailed instructions for installation, setup, and usage of the application, facilitating easy adoption and customization.
